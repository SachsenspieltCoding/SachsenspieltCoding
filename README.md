## 🎓 About Me

I am currently a **student**, where I’m deepening my theoretical understanding of computer science to complement my years of hands-on coding. My background as a school event technician has given me a unique perspective on hardware-software integration and real-world problem solving.

While my roots are in Full-Stack web development, I enjoy exploring:
* **Event Technology:** Exploring how software can optimize live productions.
* **Hobby Interests:** Manageing the server infrastructure of my local voluntary firefighting depratment I am part of.

## 🛠️ Projects

### 🏗️ Future Ventures (In Stealth)
Following my experience in event tech, I am currently developing a new project specifically for the **event industry**. It’s in the early stages and under wraps for now—stay tuned for updates as it matures.

### 🏛️ Vertretungsapp (Legacy)
The **Vertretungsapp** project has been discontinued and is now publicly archived. It served as a great learning milestone for creating alternatives to proprietary school software, and the codebase remains available for educational reference.

### 🤖 NPLAY Discord Bot
I continue to support the **[NPLAY](https://discord.gg/nplay)** community. Along with [@Kaktushose](https://github.com/Kaktushose/), I help maintain the custom moderation bot for one of Germany's largest simulation YouTube channels. You can view the source [here](https://github.com/nplay-team/moderation-bot).

### 📈 Let's Connect
I’m always happy to chat about open-source, university life, or the intersection of code and live events. Feel free to reach out!
